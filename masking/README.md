#  Cartoon Image Converter

A Python application that converts real-life images into a **cartoon-style** image using **OpenCV** and **NumPy**.  
This project detects edges, smooths colors, and blends them to produce a comic/cartoon-like effect.

---

##  Features
- Converts normal images into cartoon-style output.
- Edge detection using **Adaptive Thresholding**.
- Color smoothing with **Bilateral Filtering**.
- Adjustable cartoon intensity and color levels.
- Works with JPG, PNG, and JPEG formats.
- Simple, lightweight, and runs offline.

---

##  Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib

##  Project Structure
```
 CartoonImageConverter
 ┣  cartoonify.py       # Main Python script
 ┣  dog.JPG              # Sample image
 ┣  README.md            # Project documentation
 ┗  requirements.txt     # Python dependencies
```

##  Installation & Setup

### 1️ Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/krishna-ammu05/PythonOpenCV.git
cd PythonOpenCV
```

### 2️ Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate       # Windows
```

### 3️ Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**`requirements.txt`**
```
opencv-python
numpy
matplotlib
```

##  Usage
1. Place your image in the same directory as the script (or note the full path).
2. Run the program:
```bash
python cartoonify.py
```
3. Enter the image filename when prompted:
```
Enter image file name or path: dog.JPG
```
4. The program will display:
   - Original Image
   - Edge Mask
   - Color Quantized Image
   - Blurred Image
   - Final Cartoon Image

---

##  Example Output
**Input Image**  
![Original](dog.JPG)  

**Cartoon Output**  
*(Generated by the script)*  
![Cartoon](cartoon_dog.JPG)  

---

##  Troubleshooting
- **Error: file not found** → Make sure you typed the exact filename including extension (e.g., `.JPG` not `.PNG`).
- **Wrong path** → Either place the image in the same folder as the script or provide the full path (e.g., `C:/Users/Name/Pictures/photo.jpg`).
